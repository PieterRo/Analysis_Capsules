I want a single still frame visualizing the attention effect on the stimulusCompute OUT (do not modify):OUT = attention_modulation_V1_3bin(R3, Tall_V1, SNRnorm, opts);Significance (hard rule):* Use  OUT.pValueTD to select significant sites.* Default threshold: OUT.pValueTD < 0.05 (do not use any other significance measure unless explicitly asked).* Apply this significance mask at the site level.Time window:* Use the window corresponding to 300–500 ms (3rd window) as before.What to plot (single panel):* A single figure like plot_projected_activity_on_example_stim that shows both capsule curves/outlines (target + distractor) in one panel.* Overlay projected attentional difference onto the appropriate curve regions.Inclusion rules per stimulus (hard constraints):For a chosen stimID_example:* Include only site contributions where the RF assignment for that stimulus is on the target curve or distractor curve.* Exclude any site-stimulus cases where the RF is in the overlap region for that stimulus.* Stimulus indexing is by stimulus ID 1..384.Effect magnitude and sign routing (critical):* Obtain a per-site scalar effect for the 300–500 ms window.* Route the sign so we only plot positive values in red:o On the target curve region, plot max(0, T ? D) as red intensity.o On the distractor curve region, plot max(0, D ? T) = max(0, -(T ? D)) as red intensity.* Do not use blue or diverging colormaps; negative TD should appear on the distractor curve, not as a negative color.Visualization constraints (subtle effect):* Do not wash out weak effects with transparency:o Use constant alpha (preferred) or a mildly clipped alpha range (e.g., 0.5–0.9), but avoid alpha ? magnitude with near-zero values disappearing.* Use robust scaling so outliers don’t dominate:o Set color scaling based on a robust statistic (e.g., 95th percentile of all positive magnitudes actually plotted on either curve for this stimulus).Projection method:* Reuse canonical coordinate system and affine transform logic from plot_projected_activity_on_example_stim.Use the same plotting conventions as when we plotted activityDeliverables:1. A MATLAB function (can be a new version): plot_projected_attentiondiff_on_example_stim(stimID_example, OUT, Tall_V1, ALLCOORDS, optsPlot) that produces the single-panel still frame.2. Console sanity checks:o nSigSites = sum(OUT.pValueTD < 0.05)o For stimID_example: number of contributing site assignments on target curve, on distractor curveo min/median/max of plotted positive values on target curve and distractor curveSafety clause (no guessing):* If OUT does not contain a clear per-site TD effect magnitude for window 3, do not guess. Instead:o print fieldnames(OUT) and sizes of candidate fieldso stop with an explanatory message about what is missing
